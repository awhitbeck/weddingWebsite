	  <h2>House and room rentals</h2>

	  We'd also recommend checking out local house/room rentals, as they can 
	  be a good alternative if you'd like to be a little closer to the wedding 
	  site or if a group of you want to share.  
	  <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> and 
	  <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a> both have some 
	  listings that look like good options &mdash; if you want some specific 
	  suggestions, feel free to contact us. EDIT: There are quite a few small places/rooms available on airbnb, but there don't seem to be a lot of large houses in the Harrisville area that are still available. So, if you'd like to stay in with a group of other wedding guests, hotels may be the best option.
