          We will add much more detail here later, but for those of you who will need to fly, here is some initial information.
          <br><br>
	  <b> Airports: </b>
          <br>
          <br>
          You can fly to either Logan International Airport (BOS) or Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (MHT). Logan is the Boston airport and is therefore usually the cheapest and most direct option for flights, but it is about a two hour drive to/from Harrisville from there.  Manchester is closer, with a drive of about 1 hr 15 minutes, and can be more convenient given its smaller size, but might have more limited flight options (Southwest does have many flights to Manchester though).
